#class in python
logical entity which is virtual in nature
class.finction()
#objects
physica entity which is real in nature
objects.function() 
#methods
methods also nothing but functions.it declared inside the class and acesss the class name only
methos.functions()

#5.A
Local variables can only be reached within their scope(like func() above).
Like in below program- there are two local variables – x and y.

def sum(x,y):
sum = x + y
return sum
print(sum(5, 10))

#global variable
A global variable can be used anywhere in the program as its scope is the entire program.
Let’s understand global variable with a very simple example -

def func(x, y):
global a
def func():
global z
print(z)
z=20
func()
print(z)
# Write a function to print your name and call the function from main method
functions = {'myfoo': foo.bar}

mystring = 'myfoo'
if mystring in functions:
    functions[mystring]()
